> 题目：Fully Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking for High-Order Players With Actuator Limitations

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

The involved players are considered to be high-order integrators with their control inputs constrained within a pre-specified region.

#### 目的

This paper explores the problem of distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in games, where players have limited knowledge on other players’ actions. A linear transformation for players’ dynamics is firstly utilized to facilitate the design of bounded control inputs incorporating multiple saturation functions. By introducing consensus protocols with adaptive and time-varying gains, the unknown actions for players are distributively estimated.

Developing fully distributed control laws for high-order players, which can accommodate **actuator limitations** and **directed communication structures**.

#### 结论

A fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is exploited, showcasing its remarkable properties:

1. Ensuring the boundedness of control inputs.
2. Avoiding any global information/parameters.
3. allowing the graph to be directed.

## 4、文章好在哪里

**优点**：

1. By employing a linear transformation to convert the players’ dynamics, control inputs with multiple saturation functions are constructed. Through a synthesis of an optimization method, a consensus algorithm and time-varying/ adaptive gain designs, a fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy with bounded control inputs is established.
2. As first- and second-order dynamics are special cases of high-order ones, the presented methods provide alternative approaches to the problem considered in [9]. The presented methods can accommodate the heterogeneity on system orders and require less computation expenditure than that of [10], especially when the order of systems is high.
3. The proposed strategy is fully distributed in the sense that no centralized control gains are involved and no knowledge on any global information is required for players. Compared with the adaptive designs under undirected graphs [11]–[13], the proposed strategy allows directed graphs and only requires one-hop communication, which is preferable for distributed systems.
4. The proposed methods are analytically studied and it is theoretically proven that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under the proposed methods.
