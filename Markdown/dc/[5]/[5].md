> 题目：Fully Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking for High-Order Players With Actuator Limitations

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

The involved players are considered to be high-order integrators with their control inputs constrained within a pre-specified region.

#### 目的

This paper explores the problem of distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in games, where players have limited knowledge on other players’ actions. A linear transformation for players’ dynamics is firstly utilized to facilitate the design of bounded control inputs incorporating multiple saturation functions. By introducing consensus protocols with adaptive and time-varying gains, the unknown actions for players are distributively estimated.

Developing fully distributed control laws for high-order players, which can accommodate ==actuator limitations== and ==directed communication structures==.

#### 结论

A fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is exploited, showcasing its remarkable properties:

1. Ensuring the boundedness of control inputs.
2. Avoiding any global information/parameters.
3. allowing the graph to be directed.
