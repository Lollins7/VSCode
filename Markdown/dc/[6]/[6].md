> 题目：Bipartite Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems With a Non-Autonomous Leader Under Directed Switching Signed Graphs

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

Bipartite consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) with directed switching signed graphs and a non-autonomous leader is studied in this brief.

#### 目的

By using the unknown input observer (UIO) technique, an observer based on relative outputs are firstly given to estimate the relative full states. Then a continuous controller consisting of two parts is given, where the first part is used to achieve bipartite consensus and the second part is utilized to cancel the eects of leader’s nonzero inputs.

#### 结论

By using stability theory of switched systems, bipartite consensus is shown to be reached if the average dwell time (ADT) is larger than a threshold.
