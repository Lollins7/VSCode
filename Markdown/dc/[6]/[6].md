> 题目：Bipartite Consensus of Multi-Agent Systems With a Non-Autonomous Leader Under Directed Switching Signed Graphs

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

Bipartite consensus of multi-agent systems (MASs) with directed switching signed graphs and a non-autonomous leader is studied in this brief.

#### 目的

By using the unknown input observer (UIO) technique, an observer based on relative outputs are firstly given to estimate the relative full states. Then a continuous controller consisting of two parts is given, where the first part is used to achieve bipartite consensus and the second part is utilized to cancel the effects of leader’s nonzero inputs.

#### 结论

By using stability theory of switched systems, bipartite consensus is shown to be reached if the average dwell time (ADT) is larger than a threshold.

**优点**：

1. The bipartite consensus controller here will not induce chattering, while those given in [12]–[17] will do. And as accurate bipartite consensus goal can be reached, therefore the controller outperforms existing approaches.
2. Less information exchange is required because the controller depends only
   on relative outputs rather than (relative) full states which were used in [12]–[16].
3. Unlike [12]–[17] that study fixed topology, this paper studies directed switching signed graphs that can characterize more practical communication networks.

**不足**：
