## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

Nash equilibrium computation problems under distributed communication scenarios are addressed in this paper. In particular, the players, including first- and second-order ones,
are considered to be affected by unknown disturbances and dynamics.

#### 目的

To accommodate this problem, the followings need to be simultaneously achieved: 

1. Distributed estimation of unknown information needed for optimizing the players’ objective functions.
2. The optimization of the players’ objective functions.
3. Dynamics stabilization for the players, especially for the accommodation of unknown disturbances and dynamics.

Based on first-order low-pass filters, an ==unknown dynamics estimator== is established (for the estimation of unknown dynamics and disturbances), by which distributed computing methods are constructed by further ==employing gradient-like optimization components== (for optimizing the players’ objective functions) and consensus components (for distributed action estimation).

#### 结论

The presented analytical investigation shows that the players’ actions and velocities (for second-order players) can converge into a small ball around the Nash equilibrium and zero respectively by choosing the control parameters properly according to the given
rules. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is adapted to address connectivity control of mobile sensors.

## 4、文章好在哪里

==优点==：

1. Unknown dynamics estimator-based approaches are developed to realize the Nash equilibrium searching for first- and second-order games under unknown dynamics and time-varying disturbances. The method simplified the structure and parameter tuning of [19], [20]. The restriction on disturbance is relaxed. The method require less communication expenditures compare with [21] and are applicable to non-quadratic objectives.
2. The errors between the players' actions and the Nash equilibrium will vanish into an arbitrarily small region by suitably choosing the control gains. For second-order players, their velocities can be attenuated to be arbitrarily close to zero.
3. The estabished algorithms are applied to the connectivity control of network mobile sensors.It can drive the engaged mobile sensors to reach a small ball around the Nash equilibrium of the connectivity control game.
