## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

In this paper, Nash equilibrium seeking among a network of players is considered. Different from many existing works on Nash equilibrium seeking in noncooperative games, the players considered in this paper **cannot directly observe** the actions of the players who are not their neighbors. Instead, the players are supposed to be capable of communicating with each other via an undirected and connected communication graph.

#### 目的

By a synthesis of **a leader-following consensus protocol** and **the gradient play**, a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is proposed for the noncooperative games. Analytical analysis on the convergence of the players’ actions to the Nash equilibrium is conducted via Lyapunov stability analysis.

#### 结论

For games with **nonquadratic payoffs**, where multiple isolated Nash equilibria may coexist in the game, a **local convergence** result is derived under certain conditions. Then, **a stronger condition is provided to derive a nonlocal convergence** result for the nonquadratic games. For **quadratic games**, it is shown that the proposed seeking strategy enables the players’ actions to converge to the **Nash equilibrium globally** under the given conditions.

## 4、文章好在哪里

**优点**：

1. 基于leader-following consensus protocol和the gradient play设计Nash equilibrium seeking策略，玩家只需要与邻居交流，就可以估计所有玩家的行动。避免了在博弈论在实际工程系统中的限制——玩家无法充分的与所有玩家进行交流。

2. 通过Lyapunov稳定性分析，可以证明提出的方法在一定条件的二次博弈与非二次博弈中，都能让玩家的行动收敛到Nash equilibrium。

**不足**：

虽然本文提出的算法在二次博弈中可以达到全局收敛，但是在非二次博弈中，在一个相对温和的条件下才可以推出局部收敛，想要达到大范围收敛，还需要更强的条件。

## 5、自我想法

1. 能否设计一个在非二次博弈中也可以达到全局收敛的算法。
2. 能否设计一个可以适用于有向通信拓扑图的策略。
