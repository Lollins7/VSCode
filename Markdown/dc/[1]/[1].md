## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

In this paper, Nash equilibrium seeking among a network of players is considered. Different from many existing works on Nash equilibrium seeking in noncooperative games, the players considered in this paper **cannot directly observe** the actions of the players who are not their neighbors. Instead, the players are supposed to be capable of communicating with each other via an undirected and connected communication graph.

#### 目的

By a synthesis of **a leader-following consensus protocol** and **the gradient play**, a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is proposed for the noncooperative games. Analytical analysis on the convergence of the players’ actions to the Nash equilibrium is conducted via Lyapunov stability analysis.

#### 结论

For games with **nonquadratic payoffs**, where multiple isolated Nash equilibria may coexist in the game, a **local convergence** result is derived under certain conditions. Then, **a stronger condition is provided to derive a nonlocal convergence** result for the nonquadratic games. For **quadratic games**, it is shown that the proposed seeking strategy enables the players’ actions to converge to the **Nash equilibrium globally** under the given conditions.

**优点**：

1. Nash equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games, where the players have no direct access to the actions of the players who are not their neighbors, is investigated in this paper. Based on a leader-following consensus protocol and the gradient play, a Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is designed. In the proposed algorithm, the players only need to communicate with their neighbors on their estimates of the players’ actions. Avoiding full communication among the players broadens the applicability of game theory to engineering systems where only local communication is attainable.
2. The convergence of the players’ actions to the Nash equilibrium by utilizing the proposed seeking strategy is analytically explored. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the proposed method enables the players’ actions to converge to the Nash equilibrium under certain conditions.

## 5、自我想法

The players in this paper are supposed to be equipped with an undirected and connected communication graph. Can I extent it to directed graph? In other words, can I conclude a same conclusion in directed graph?

The designed strategy in this paper is perfect in quadratic games, but not in nonquadratic games. Can I relax the conditions of the strategy or design a good strategy for nonquadratic games?
