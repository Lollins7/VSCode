> 题目：Adaptive approaches for fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in networked games

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景



#### 目的

This paper considers the design of ==fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategies== for networked games. To develop fully distributed seeking strategies, two adaptive control laws, including a ==node-based control law== and an ==edge-based control law==, are proposed.

In the ==node-based adaptive strategy==, each player adjusts their own weight on their procurable consensus error dynamically.

 Moreover, in the ==edge-based algorithm==, the fully distributed strategy is designed by adding an adaptively adjusted scaling parameter to the weights of the edges of the communication graph.

#### 结论

By utilizing ==LaSalle’s invariance principle==, it is shown that the Nash equilibrium is ==globally asymptotically stable== under both strategies.

In addition, we further show that the edge-based method can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication conditions, in which the communication network is switching among a set of undirected and connected graphs.

## 3、文章好在哪里

==内容==：

在近几年中，Distributed Nash equilibrium seeking在网络博弈是一个蓬勃发展的主，continuous-time consensus-based算法在解决不完全信息的网络博弈中是一个很有用的工具。

但是consensus-based算法也有缺点，即在量化控制增益依赖于博弈中玩家的目标函数、通信拓扑图的结构和玩家的数量。

==优点==：



==不足==：
