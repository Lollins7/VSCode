> 题目：Adaptive approaches for fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in networked games

## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

Considering the design of **fully distributed Nash equilibrium seeking** strategies for networked games. With the adaptive control laws, the proposed methods are free of any centralized control gains, i.e., the players can update their actions without knowing any centralized information.

#### 目的

To develop fully distributed seeking strategies, two adaptive control laws, including a **node-based control law** and an **edge-based control law**, are proposed.

In the **node-based adaptive strategy**, each player adjusts their own weight on their procurable consensus error dynamically.

 Moreover, in the **edge-based algorithm**, the fully distributed strategy is designed by adding an adaptively adjusted scaling parameter to the weights of the edges of the communication graph.

#### 结论

By utilizing **LaSalle’s invariance principle**, it is shown that the Nash equilibrium is **globally asymptotically stable** under both strategies.

In addition, we further show that the edge-based method can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication conditions, in which the communication network is switching among a set of undirected and connected graphs.

## 4、文章好在哪里

**优点**：

1. A node-based adaptive strategy and an edge-based adaptive strategy are proposed to achieve the fully distributed seeking of Nash equilibrium in networked games. Compared with [Bianchi and Grammatico (0000)] and [De Persis and Grammatico (2019)] that established the algorithms from a passivity perspective, the methods proposed in this paper provide new insight into the design of fully distributed seeking algorithms. Moreover, a noticeable distinction between the algorithms proposed in this paper and those in [Bianchi and Grammatico (0000)] and [De Persis and Grammatico (2019)] is that the algorithms proposed in this paper do not require two-hop communication.
2. Based on the LaSalle’s invariance principle, it is theoretically shown that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under both seeking strategies given that the provided assumptions are satisfied.
3. Extensions to time-varying communication topologies where the communication network switches among a set of undirected and connected graphs is discussed for the edge-based Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm. It is shown that the edge-based algorithm can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication graphs. This extension is new to the community as the related existing works only considered fixed communication topologies.

**不足**：

1. Can I extend the algorithm to switching directed communication graph?

## 5、自我想法

1. 与我看的前两篇论文不同，本文考虑的是完全分布式Nash均衡，设计了一个自适应参数。分别对node-based和edge-based的方法进行了讨论。
   - node-based：每个玩家动态地调整他们可获取的一致性误差的权重。
   - edge-based：在通信图边的权值上添加自适应调整参数。
2. 本文提出的edge-based算法能适用于切换无向连接通信图。
