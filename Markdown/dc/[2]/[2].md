## 2、背景、目的及结论

#### 背景

This paper investigates distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in **multiagent games under switching communication topologies**. To be specific, the communication topology is supposed to be switching among a set of **strongly connected digraphs**, which might suffer from **occasional loss of communication** due to sensor failure, packet loss, etc.

#### 目的

The synthesis of **the leader-following consensus protocol** and **the gradient play** is exploited to achieve the distributed Nash equilibrium seeking under the switching communication topologies.

#### 结论

**Switching topology without loss of communication** is firstly considered, followed by **switching topology subject to missing communication within some time slots**. 

For both situations, nonquadratic and quadratic games are addressed separately. **Local convergence** results are presented for **nonquadratic games** and **nonlocal convergence** results are provided for **quadratic games**.

## 4、文章好在哪里

**优点**：

1. Distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for multiagent games under switching communication topologies is investigated. To be more specific, the communication topology is supposed to be switching among a set of directed graphs, each of which is strongly connected.
2. To accommodate the unreliable communication conditions in practical situations, the effect of occasional loss of communication in the switching topologies is explored in this paper.
3. For both situations (i.e., switching topologies and switching topologies subject to occasional loss of communication), the convergence properties for both nonquadratic games and quadratic games are analytically studied by utilizing Lyapunov stability analysis. For nonquadratic games, local convergence to the Nash equilibrium is presented and for quadratic games, nonlocal convergence results are given under certain conditions.

**不足**：

1. The proposed seeking strategy still works if the loss of communication lasts for a short time. How to improve the duration of time?
1. Nonlocal convergence results require strong assumptions for nonquadratic games, only local convergence results are provided for nonquadratic games in this paper. Can I design a good strategy with a week condition?

## 5、自我想法

1. 本文设计的算法可以使用在有向的切换通信拓扑图中。
2. 并且在假定通信信号丢失的时间足够短，算法依旧有效。

## A、注

1. 本文中的图为有向图，定义其Laplace Matrix为入度矩阵与邻接矩阵的差，即$L = D - A$，这里的$A$为入度矩阵（indegree matrix），矩阵的第$i$行表示第$i$个节点接收的权重，比如从第$j$个节点到第$i$个节点的权重为3，那么$a_{ij}=3$。
